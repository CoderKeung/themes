# Blink Shell Themes

With [Blink Shell](http://www.blink.sh) you can have your terminal, your way. We know how important it is for you to have your color scheme and the font that you feel comfortable looking at all day. And don't forget to send us your PR to share them with others too!

[Blink Shell](http://www.blink.sh) uses [Chromium's HTerm](https://chromium.googlesource.com/apps/libapps/+/HEAD/hterm) under the hood. This means our themes are also compatible with [Chrome's Secure Shell](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo)

To install them on Blink, just paste the URL of the JS theme under Appearance -> Themes -> New Theme. If you would like to learn how to create your own, [continue reading!](https://github.com/blinksh/blink/blob/raw/Resources/FontsAndThemes.md)
